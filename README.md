# Election_Data_Myanmar

<p> This is the Data Visualization that my Team and I created for the Challange of "Visualizing Election with Data" for Myanmar Election 2020. As I tend to keep this open source, I also attach my datasets and the workbook. Feel free to use but make sure to credit to this Repo or my github account profile link. Thank You. </p>
